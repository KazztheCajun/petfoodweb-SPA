# Pet Food Tracker (Web App)
Announcing an easy way to track your pet's health!

### Abstract:
A few years ago, one of my cats was diagnosed with advanced Feline Hepatic Lipidosis, the treatment for which is to get them to eat a ton of food so their liver can regenerate healthy cells.  In the process of this monumental task, my partner created an intricate set of Excel spreadsheets to track and monitor his caloric intake, which ultimately turned a fatal diagnosis into a recovery.  When working with his vets, they would often comment on how helpful the spreadsheets were in tracking the progress of his condition and his overall health.  Unfortunately, Excel is not the most user-friendly for the common user, so we came up with the idea of adapting them into an App.  The goal of this will be to give everyone an easy way to track their pet’s health and share it with their vets.

### Features:
* Easy to use web-based application that will allow a user to 
* create a household to store your pet’s information and record feeding events for meals and treats.  
* See detailed information based on the food they are fed, such as calories per day graphs, nutritional breakdowns, etc.  
* Nutritional information of popular pet food and treat brands
* Export your pet’s information to easily share with your vet
